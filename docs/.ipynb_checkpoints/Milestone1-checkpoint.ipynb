    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "*Describe problem the software solves and why it's important to solve that problem*\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation (AD) is implemented in this software. More specifically, it can automatically differentiate of a python function up to machine precision and it can take derivatives of derivatives. Obtaining derivatives accurately is important because it is the key part of gradient-based optimization, which is the foundation of many machine learning algorithms. As a matter of fact, most machine learning problems can be divided into following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. define a function connecting some input $X$ with some output $Y$ with a set of parameters $\\beta$ as $Y = f(X,\\beta)$;\n",
    "2. define a loss function to check how good the model is $L(X,Y,\\beta)$;\n",
    "3. find the parameter set $\\beta$ that minimize the loss function: argmin$_\\beta L(X,Y,\\beta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally the power or performance of a machine learning algorithm is limited by the third step which is can be handled by gradient-based optimization. Therefore, our software can be used in various machine learning packages and boost their performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, AD can also be applied to solve differential equations in various physical systems. Such as, diffusion equations, wave equations, Navierâ€“Stokes equations and other non-linear equations which cannot be solved analytically. Traditional numerical method using difference method possess error much larger than machine error. Therefore, applying AD will possibly increase the accuracy of the solvers of those differential equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "*Describe (briefly) the mathematical background and concepts as you see fit.  You **do not** need to\n",
    "give a treatise on automatic differentiation or dual numbers.  Just give the essential ideas (e.g.\n",
    "the chain rule, the graph structure of calculations, elementary functions, etc).*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is AD?\n",
    "\n",
    "AD is a set of techniques to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function specified by a computer program based on the fact that every computer program execute a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations and elementary functions. Using the chain rule, the derivative of each sub-expression can be calculated recursively to obtain the final derivatives. Depending on the sequence of calculating those sub-expressions, there are two major method of doing AD: **forward accumulation** and **reverse accumulation**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why AD?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, there are two ways of doing differentiation, i.e., symbolic differentiation (SD) and numerical differentiation (ND). SD gives exact expression of the derivatives and produce differentiation up to machine precision, while SD is very inefficient since the expression could become very during differentiation. ND on the other hand, suffers from round-off errors (or truncate error), which leads to bad precision. Moreover, both ND and SD have problems with calculating higher derivatives and they are slow for vector inputs with large size. AD solves all of these problems nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to do AD?\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering a simple function:\n",
    "$$z = \\cos(x)\\sin(y) + \\frac{x}{y}$$\n",
    "In AD, its computational graph for forward accumulation method looks like:\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/Fig1.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "Accoring to the graph, the simple function can be rewritten as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "z = \\cos(x)\\sin(y) + \\frac{x}{y}=\\cos(w_1) \\sin(w_2) + \\frac{w_1}{w_2}=w_3 w_4+w_6=w_5 + w_6=w_7\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "The derivates with respect to $x$ and $y$ can be calcualted according to chain rule as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}&=\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial w_7}\\left(\\frac{\\partial w_7}{\\partial w_5}\\frac{\\partial w_5}{\\partial w_3}\\frac{\\partial w_3}{\\partial w_1}+\\frac{\\partial w_7}{\\partial w_6}\\frac{\\partial w_6}{\\partial w_1}\\right)\\frac{\\partial w_1}{\\partial x}\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}&=\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial w_7}\\left(\\frac{\\partial w_7}{\\partial w_5}\\frac{\\partial w_5}{\\partial w_4}\\frac{\\partial w_4}{\\partial w_2}+\\frac{\\partial w_7}{\\partial w_6}\\frac{\\partial w_6}{\\partial w_2}\\right)\\frac{\\partial w_2}{\\partial y}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}$ are just the combinations of derivatives of elementary functions, which can be calculated analytically. In forward accumulation, the chain rule are applied from inside to outside. Computationally, the values of $w_i$ and their derivatives are store along the chain accumulatively.\n",
