    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation (AD) is implemented in this software. More specifically, it can automatically differentiate of a python function up to machine precision and it can take derivatives of derivatives. Obtaining derivatives accurately is important because it is the key part of gradient-based optimization, which is the foundation of many machine learning algorithms. As a matter of fact, most machine learning problems can be divided into following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. define a function connecting some input $X$ with some output $Y$ with a set of parameters $\\beta$ as $Y = f(X,\\beta)$;\n",
    "2. define a loss function to check how good the model is $L(X,Y,\\beta)$;\n",
    "3. find the parameter set $\\beta$ that minimize the loss function: argmin$_\\beta L(X,Y,\\beta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally the power or performance of a machine learning algorithm is limited by the third step which is can be handled by gradient-based optimization. Therefore, our software can be used in various machine learning packages and boost their performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, AD can also be applied to solve differential equations in various physical systems. Such as, diffusion equations, wave equations, Navierâ€“Stokes equations and other non-linear equations which cannot be solved analytically. Traditional numerical method using difference method possess error much larger than machine error. Therefore, applying AD will possibly increase the accuracy of the solvers of those differential equations. "

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "*Describe (briefly) the mathematical background and concepts as you see fit.  You **do not** need to\n",
    "give a treatise on automatic differentiation or dual numbers.  Just give the essential ideas (e.g.\n",
    "the chain rule, the graph structure of calculations, elementary functions, etc).*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is AD?\n",
    "\n",
    "AD is a set of techniques to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function specified by a computer program based on the fact that every computer program execute a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations and elementary functions. Using the chain rule, the derivative of each sub-expression can be calculated recursively to obtain the final derivatives. Depending on the sequence of calculating those sub-expressions, there are two major method of doing AD: **forward accumulation** and **reverse accumulation**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why AD?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, there are two ways of doing differentiation, i.e., symbolic differentiation (SD) and numerical differentiation (ND). SD gives exact expression of the derivatives and produce differentiation up to machine precision, while SD is very inefficient since the expression could become very during differentiation. ND on the other hand, suffers from round-off errors (or truncate error), which leads to bad precision. Moreover, both ND and SD have problems with calculating higher derivatives and they are slow for vector inputs with large size. AD solves all of these problems nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to do AD?\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering a simple function:\n",
    "$$z = \\cos(x)\\sin(y) + \\frac{x}{y}$$\n",
    "In AD, its computational graph for forward accumulation method looks like:\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/Fig1.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "Accoring to the graph, the simple function can be rewritten as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "z = \\cos(x)\\sin(y) + \\frac{x}{y}=\\cos(w_1) \\sin(w_2) + \\frac{w_1}{w_2}=w_3 w_4+w_6=w_5 + w_6=w_7\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "The derivates with respect to $x$ and $y$ can be calcualted according to chain rule as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}&=\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial w_7}\\left(\\frac{\\partial w_7}{\\partial w_5}\\frac{\\partial w_5}{\\partial w_3}\\frac{\\partial w_3}{\\partial w_1}+\\frac{\\partial w_7}{\\partial w_6}\\frac{\\partial w_6}{\\partial w_1}\\right)\\frac{\\partial w_1}{\\partial x}\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}&=\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial w_7}\\left(\\frac{\\partial w_7}{\\partial w_5}\\frac{\\partial w_5}{\\partial w_4}\\frac{\\partial w_4}{\\partial w_2}+\\frac{\\partial w_7}{\\partial w_6}\\frac{\\partial w_6}{\\partial w_2}\\right)\\frac{\\partial w_2}{\\partial y}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}$ are just the combinations of derivatives of elementary functions, which can be calculated analytically. In forward accumulation, the chain rule are applied from inside to outside. Computationally, the values of $w_i$ and their derivatives are store along the chain accumulatively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operator overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator overloading is applied in this package to realize AD. Values and derivatives of functions are updated and passed at each operation. That means if we have two functions $\\omega_1 (x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ and $\\omega_2 (x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ with their derivatives ${\\partial\\omega_1}/{\\partial x_i}$ and ${\\partial\\omega_1}/{\\partial x_i}$ and second derivatives ${\\partial^2\\omega_1}/{\\partial x_i}{\\partial x_j}$ and ${\\partial^2\\omega_2}/{\\partial x_i}{\\partial x_j}$, $\\forall i,j$. For a new variable $\\omega_3 = \\omega_1*\\omega_2$, where $*$ is some operator (addition, multiplication, division, power, etc). Accoring to specific types of the operator we can write down analytical expression of the values as well the derivatives of $\\omega_3$ as functions of $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ and their derivatives. The following expression shows these analytical expressions:\n",

    "### GMRES - Generalized Minimal Residual Method\n",
    "GMRES is an iterative method to solve system of linear equations which approximates the solution by the vector in a Krylov subspace with minimal residual. There are two ways to solve a linear system $Ax = b$ using `scipy.sparse.linalg.gmres`. One way is to pass in the matrix A and vector b directly to the gmres function as `scipy.sparse.linalg.gmres(A, b)`. The other way is to pass in an action and the vector b to the gmres function as `scipy.sparse.linalg.gmres(action, b)` where action is a LinearOperator with a user-defined 'action' passed in argument to the `matvec` parameter. This is possible because GMRES only requires the matrix-vector product for it to work, instead of the entire matrix A. This property enables us to use automatic differentiation to churn out the 'action' to pass in to the gmres function, since the result of automatic differentiation is already the matrix-vector product we want for GMRES!\n",

    "This feature can be used in the following way: \n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> import AutoDiff.AutoDiff as ad\n",

    "array([ 1., -1.,  1.])\n",
